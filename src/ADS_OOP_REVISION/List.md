### Part A
### **Question 1 – Customer Discount Correction System**
**[Total: 17 marks]**

A retail store uses a transaction system to record each customer's purchase at checkout. Each customer has a name, purchase amount, loyalty tier, and the hour of purchase (in 24-hour format). The store operates from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM (21:00).

Due to a software bug, a **flat 5% discount** was mistakenly applied to all customers during the **last hour of operation (20:00–21:00)**. The correct discount policy is based on loyalty:

- **Bronze**: 5%
- **Silver**: 10%
- **Gold**: 25%

The system currently stores customers in a **singly linked list** in the order they checked out.

---

### **Given Classes:**

```java
class Customer {
    private String name;
    private double lastPurchase;  // already reduced by 5% due to bug
    private String loyaltyTier;   // "Bronze", "Silver", "Gold"
    private int hour;             // 9 to 21 (24-hour format)

    public Customer(String name, double lastPurchase, String loyaltyTier, int hour) {
        this.name = name;
        this.lastPurchase = lastPurchase;
        this.loyaltyTier = loyaltyTier;
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public double getLastPurchase() { return lastPurchase; }
    public String getLoyaltyTier() { return loyaltyTier; }
    public int getHour() { return hour; }

    // Setter
    public void setLastPurchase(double amount) { this.lastPurchase = amount; }

    // Returns correct discount rate
    public double getCorrectDiscountRate() {
        switch(loyaltyTier) {
            case "Gold": return 0.25;
            case "Silver": return 0.10;
            case "Bronze": return 0.05;
            default: return 0.05;
        }
    }
}
```

```java
class TransactionLog {
    private Node head;

    private class Node {
        Customer customer;
        Node next;

        public Node(Customer customer) {
            this.customer = customer;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    public TransactionLog() {
        head = null;
    }

    // Adds customer to the end of the list (chronological order)
    public void addCustomer(Customer customer) {
        Node newNode = new Node(customer);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }
}
```

### **(a)**
Write a method in the `TransactionLog` class called:
```java
public void correctLastHourDiscounts()
```
This method must:
- Traverse the **entire linked list**
- Identify customers who checked out between **20:00 and 21:00 (inclusive)**
- For each such customer:
    - **Reverse the incorrect 5% discount**
    - Apply the **correct discount** based on loyalty tier
    - Update the `lastPurchase` with the corrected value


**[8 marks]**

---

### **(b)**
Explain why using a **singly linked list** is **inefficient** for this type of operation — especially if the store needs to **frequently correct the most recent transactions**.

Suggest a **better data structure** for storing transactions when **recent entries need to be accessed or modified quickly**, and justify your choice.

**[4 marks]**

---

### **(c)**
Describe how the **stack** data structure follows the **LIFO principle**, and explain why this makes it **particularly suitable** for modeling **transaction undo systems** or **rollback operations** in point-of-sale software.

**[3 marks]**

---

### **(d)**
State **one disadvantage** of using a stack for this transaction system if the store also needs to **generate daily reports sorted by time** or **search for a customer by name**.

**[2 marks]**

---



### **Task 1 (c): Binary Search Application**

The store now wants to **quickly find a customer by name** in a **separate sorted array** of customers (not the linked list). The array is sorted alphabetically by name.

Write a **binary search method** (not in the list class) that searches for a customer by name and returns the index, or -1 if not found.

Assume you are given:
```java
Customer[] sortedCustomers; // sorted by name
```

Write the method:
```java
public int binarySearchCustomer(Customer[] arr, String targetName)
```

You may assume `Customer` has a `getName()` method.

**[6 marks]**

> 🔎 *Note: This tests understanding of binary search preconditions (sorted data) and implementation.*

---

## **Question 2: Stack Applications**

### **Standard Stack Operation**

You are given a **stack of integers**. Write a method that **reverses the stack** using **only one queue** as auxiliary storage.

You may only use standard stack and queue operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`).

Write the method:
```java
public void reverseStack(Stack<Integer> stack)
```

**[6 marks]**

> 💡 *Hint: Use the queue to temporarily store elements, then re-push them back.*
